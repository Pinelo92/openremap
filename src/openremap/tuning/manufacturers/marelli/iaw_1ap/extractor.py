Magneti Marelli IAW 1AP ECU binary extractor.

Implements BaseManufacturerExtractor for the Magneti Marelli IAW 1AP family:
  IAW 1AP — Peugeot/Citroën single-point fuel injection ECUs (~1996–2002)
            Peugeot 106 1.0/1.1/1.4i, Peugeot 206 1.1/1.4i,
            Citroën Saxo 1.0/1.1/1.4i, Citroën C3 1.1/1.4i
            ST6 microcontroller (ST62T65C), 64KB (0x10000) internal flash

These are ST6-based single-point injection ECUs from Magneti Marelli.  The
entire program (code + calibration) is contained in a single 64KB flash
dump.  They are EXTREMELY sparse on identifying text — almost no printable
ASCII strings exist in the binary.

Binary structure:

  Size            : 65,536 bytes (0x10000) — always exactly 64KB.

  Header          : Bytes 0x00–0x0F are all 0xFF (erased vector area).
                    Code begins at offset 0x10 with ST6 machine opcodes.

  Code + cal      : 0x0010–0x5F8F — ST6 machine code and calibration data.
                    The only identifying ASCII text is the 3-byte family
                    tag ``1ap`` (lowercase) at fixed offset 0x5F8D, sitting
                    at the very end of the calibration data block:
                      ...33333333333331ap  followed by 0xFF padding.

  FF padding      : 0x5F90–0x5FF7 — erased flash fill (all 0xFF).

  Data / tables   : 0x6000–0xFFFF — lookup tables and map data.

  Sync marker     : 4-byte sequence ``AA 55 CC 33`` at offset 0x4810.
                    Followed by calibration fingerprint bytes.

Detection strategy (can_handle):

  This is a very minimal ECU with almost no identifying strings.  Detection
  must be strict to avoid false positives against other 64KB binaries.

  Phase 1 — Size gate: exactly 65,536 bytes (0x10000).
  Phase 2 — Header check: first 16 bytes must all be 0xFF.
  Phase 3 — Exclusion: reject if ANY known competitor/sibling signature
            is found.  Critically, ``MARELLI`` is excluded because IAW 1AP
            does NOT contain that string — IAW 1AV does, and this is the
            primary way to distinguish them.
  Phase 4 — Family anchor: ``b"1ap"`` (lowercase!) must be present in the
            range 0x5F80–0x5FA0.
  Phase 5 — Sync marker: ``AA 55 CC 33`` must be present somewhere in the
            binary.

Extraction:

  Since this ECU has almost no extractable text:
    - ecu_family        = "IAW 1AP"
    - software_version  = None  (not stored in binary)
    - hardware_number   = None  (not stored in binary)
    - oem_part_number   = None  (not stored in binary)
    - calibration_id    = 8 hex chars from the 4 bytes after the AA55CC33
                          sync marker at offset 0x4810, e.g. "50960654"

  The ``match_key_fallback_field`` is set to ``"calibration_id"`` so that
  the match key can be built without software_version.

  Match key format: ``IAW 1AP::50960654``

Verified sample:
  Peugeot 206 1.4i — 65,536 bytes, family tag "1ap" at 0x5F8D,
                      sync marker AA55CC33 at 0x4810,
                      calibration fingerprint bytes 50 96 06 54 after marker.
