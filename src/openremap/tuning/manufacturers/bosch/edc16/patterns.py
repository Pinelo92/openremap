Bosch EDC16 ECU binary identifier patterns and search regions.

Covers the Bosch EDC16 family:
  EDC16C8   — VW/Audi/Seat/Skoda 1.9 TDI and 2.4 JTD (2003–2006)
              e.g. Alfa 147/156/GT 1.9 JTDM, Alfa 156/166 2.4 JTD
  EDC16C39  — later variant, larger MCU (2005–2008)
              e.g. Alfa 159 2.4 JTDM, Alfa GT 1.9 JTD 150HP
  EDC16U1/U31 — VAG PD (Pumpe-Düse / unit-injector) engines (2004–2008)
              e.g. Audi A3/A4 1.9 TDI BKC/BKE, 2.0 TDI BKD (03G906016xx)
  EDC16C9   — Opel/GM Vectra-C, Signum, Astra-H diesel (2004–2006)
              e.g. Opel Vectra CDTI 120PS (0281013409, sw=1037A50286)
              active_start = 0xC0000; DECAFE at 0xC003D

EDC16 sits between EDC15 and EDC17 generationally:
  - CPU: Infineon TriCore TC1766 (C8) or TC1796 (C39/U-series)
  - No TSW string (that was EDC15-era toolchain only)
  - No SB_V, NR000, Customer. strings (those are EDC17+)
  - No 0xC3 fill (EDC15 characteristic) — fill byte is 0xFF
  - SW version stored as plain ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at a fixed offset
    within the active flash section (always active_start + 0x10)
  - HW number is NOT stored as plain ASCII anywhere in the binary
  - ECU family string embedded as slash-delimited descriptor when present:
    "EDC16C8/009/C277/ /110000_000/..."
    "EDC16C39/009/C456/ /010000_000/..."
    (absent in VAG PD variants — identified by layout alone)

Binary structure and file sizes:

  EDC16C8  — 1MB (0x100000 bytes), Alfa/VW common-rail:
    Header magic    : \xde\xca\xfe at 0x4003d and 0xe003d
                      (active_start + 0x3d)
    SW version      : Plain ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at 0x40010
                      (confirmed at 0xe0010 as second copy)
    ECU family str  : "EDC16C8/..." at ~0xe054b (varies slightly by tune)
    Active section  : starts at 0x40000 (last 768KB used)
    High fill       : 0xFF accounts for 70–90% of the file

  EDC16C39 — 2MB (0x200000 bytes), Alfa/VW common-rail:
    Header magic    : \xde\xca\xfe at 0x1c003d
    SW version      : Plain ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at 0x1c0010
    ECU family str  : "EDC16C39/..." at 0x1c0601 (fixed)
    Active section  : starts at 0x1c0000 (last 256KB used)
    High fill       : 0xFF accounts for 90%+ of the file

  EDC16C31/C35 — 2MB (0x200000 bytes), BMW diesel (E46/E60/E90 320d/120d/335d):
    Header magic    : \xde\xca\xfe at 0x4003d  (active_start=0x40000)
                      OR at 0xc003d (active_start=0xc0000, e.g. X6 30sd)
    SW version      : Plain ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at active_start + 0x10
    ECU family str  : "EDC16C31/..." or "EDC16C35/..." or "EDC16CP35/..."
    Active section  : starts at 0x40000 (most BMW C31/C35) or 0xc0000 (X6)
    High fill       : 0xFF accounts for 35–50% of the file
    Note            : physically the same MCU generation as C8/C39 but with
                      a BMW-specific flash sector map; the active section sits
                      at 0x40000 in the 2MB address space instead of 0x1c0000.

  EDC16 truncated — 983040 bytes (0xF0000 = 1MB - 64KB), BMW diesel:
    A 1MB EDC16C31/C35 image where the first 64KB boot sector was not
    captured by the read tool, leaving a file 64KB short of 1MB.
    Header magic    : \xde\xca\xfe at 0x3003d  (active_start=0x30000,
                      which maps to 0x40000 in the full 1MB address space)
    SW version      : Plain ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at 0x30010
    ECU family str  : "EDC16C31/..." or "EDC16C35/..."
    Active section  : starts at 0x30000 (= full-image 0x40000 minus 64KB)

  EDC16 VAG PD — 1MB (0x100000 bytes), Pumpe-Düse engines:
    Header magic    : \xde\xca\xfe at 0xd003d  (active_start + 0x3d)
                      Also mirrored at 0x3d and 0x8003d (boot/mirror sections)
    SW version      : Plain ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at 0xd0010
                      (active_start + 0x10); also mirrored at 0x10 and 0x80010
    ECU family str  : NOT present as plain ASCII in any observed PD bin
    Active section  : starts at 0xd0000
    Part numbers    : 03G906016xx (Audi A3/A4 1.9 TDI BKC/BKD/BKE, 2.0 TDI BKD)
    Distinction     : three DECAFE copies at 0x3d / 0x8003d / 0xd003d
                      (vs C8 which has copies at 0x3d / 0x8003d / 0xe003d)

  EDC16C9 — 1MB (0x100000 bytes), Opel/GM common-rail (Vectra-C/Signum/Astra-H):
    Header magic    : \xde\xca\xfe at 0xC003d  (active_start + 0x3d)
    SW version      : ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at 0xC0010; the 6-character suffix may
                      contain uppercase hex digits A–F (e.g. "1037A50286")
    ECU family str  : "EDC16C9/..." when present in calibration area
    Active section  : starts at 0xC0000
    DECAFE copies   : 0x3d / 0x8003d / 0xC003d
    Distinction     : third DECAFE copy at 0xC003d (vs C8 at 0xe003d,
                      PD at 0xd003d) is the Opel-layout discriminator

  EDC16 sector dump — 256KB (0x40000 bytes):
    A standalone calibration/active-section-only read. The file begins
    directly with the active section header — no prefix or padding.
    Header magic    : \xde\xca\xfe at 0x3d  (file start = active_start)
    SW version      : Plain ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at 0x10
    ECU family str  : not present in observed sector dumps
    Active section  : starts at 0x0 (entire file IS the active section)
    Observed for    : 03G906016xx part numbers (same PD engines as above,
                      different dump method — single-sector read only)

  EDC16 half-flash dump — 512KB (0x80000 = 524288 bytes):
    A partial flash read that captures the active section plus additional
    calibration/data sectors beyond the 256KB sector-only dump. The file
    begins directly with the active section header (same as 256KB layout)
    but includes twice as much flash content.
    Header magic    : \xde\xca\xfe at 0x3d  (file start = active_start)
    SW version      : Plain ASCII "1037xxxxxx" at 0x10
    ECU family str  : may or may not be present
    Active section  : starts at 0x0
    OEM part number : embedded as plain ASCII in data area (e.g. at ~0x40CAE)
    Observed for    : 03G906021LL (Seat Leon 2.0 TDI 140HP, sw=1037381350)
                      VAG PD (Pumpe-Düse) engines — same family as 256KB and
                      1MB PD dumps, different read tool / dump method.
    Note            : first bytes at offset 0x10 contain the SW version
                      followed by additional printable ASCII (e.g.
                      "1037381350P447HAS9") — the strict 10-char SW pattern
                      correctly extracts only the "1037381350" prefix.

SW version offset formula (invariant across all layouts):
  active_start + 0x10  → SW version
  active_start + 0x3d  → \xde\xca\xfe magic

Both formats share the same "\xde\xca\xfe" header magic and the
"1037xxxxxx" SW format. The EDC16 family string, when present, is the
most authoritative source for the ecu_variant (e.g. "EDC16C8").

Pattern reference:

  SOFTWARE VERSION    "1037367333"  "1037383773"  "1037A50286"
    Bosch internal software calibration identifier.
    Format: 1037 + 6 alphanumeric characters (10 characters total).
    Stored as plain ASCII at active_start + 0x10 in every known variant.
    Note: the bytes immediately following the 10-character SW may be printable
    ASCII (e.g. "P379U8...") — the pattern must match exactly 6 characters
    after "1037" to avoid returning a 13-character false value.
    Note: Opel EDC16C9 bins use alphanumeric suffixes (uppercase hex
    digits A–F allowed), e.g. "1037A50286". Pattern uses [\\dA-Fa-f]{6,10}
    to cover both purely numeric and alphanumeric SW versions.
    The primary matching key.

  ECU FAMILY STRING   "EDC16C8/009/C277/..."
    Slash-delimited descriptor embedded in the calibration data area.
    The first token before the first slash is the ecu_variant.
    Not present in all bins (absent in VAG PD variants entirely).

  HARDWARE NUMBER     not stored as plain ASCII in any observed EDC16 binary.
    Always None — the HW number appears in the filename convention only.

# The full binary is searched (not just the first 512KB) because some
# families — notably ME7.1.1 in 1MB bins (e.g. VW Golf 5 R32 3.2 VR6) —
# store all identity strings (ME7., MOTRONIC) in the upper half of the
# file.  Searching only the first 512KB missed them and allowed the
# Phase 4 flash-layout heuristic to falsely accept ME7 bins as EDC16C8.
#
# Guards against the EDC16 extractor claiming modern Bosch bins (EDC17,
# MEDC17) that share the "EDC16" substring as part of "EDC16..." in
# internal strings, against EDC15 bins that share the 1037 SW prefix,
# and against ME7 bins that share the 1MB size and a similar flash layout.
