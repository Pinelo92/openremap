Bosch Motronic M1.x ECU binary extractor.

Implements BaseManufacturerExtractor for the Bosch Motronic M1.x family:
  M1.3  — BMW 3/5/7-series 4 and 6-cylinder petrol engines (~1987–1993)
  M1.7  — BMW 3/5/7-series 4 and 6-cylinder petrol engines (~1989–1996)
  M1.x  — Generic fallback for M1-era bins with no explicit sub-variant string

These are Motorola 68HC11-based ECUs, predating the M3.x generation.
They use the same reversed-digit ident encoding as M3.x but have a completely
different binary layout — the ident block is located near the 8KB mark in the
ROM (offset ~0x1E02–0x1F02) rather than at the end of the file.

Binary structure (all variants, 32KB = 0x8000 bytes):

  ROM header      : bytes 0x00–0x03 = \x85\x0a\xf0\x30 (Motorola HC11 reset vector area)
                    This 4-byte magic is unique to the M1.x family and is the
                    primary detection anchor. It is absent from all M3.x, ME7,
                    EDC17 and modern Bosch bins.

  Family marker   : ASCII string '"0000000M1.7 ' or '"0000000M1.3 '
                    Located in the upper half of the ROM (~0x7500–0x79xx).
                    Preceded by 7 non-printable opcode bytes (\xa3\xf0\xd0...).
                    Absent from some bins (generic M1.x fallback applies).

  Ident block     : Long ASCII numeric string at ~0x1E02–0x1F02
                    Format: \d{20,40}(?:\.\d{2})?
                    Always exactly ONE match per file — no false positives observed.
                    Encodes both HW and SW in reversed-digit order (see below).
                    Reliably found within slice(0x1800, 0x2100).

  RT code         : ASCII string e.g. '07826RT3557' or '81026RT2882'
                    Located ~0xC0 bytes after the ident block (~0x1EC0–0x1FC0).
                    Present in most but not all bins (BMW_179.bin has none).
                    Not used for identification — display only.

  No DME code     : Unlike M3.x, M1.x bins do NOT contain a 'NNN/NNN NNNN'
                    DME type string. calibration_id is derived from the RT code
                    when present, otherwise None.

HW / SW encoding — identical to M3.x:

    ident_clean = ident_num.split('.')[0]   # strip optional .NN decimal suffix
    hw          = ident_clean[0:10][::-1]   # first 10 digits reversed -> 0261xxxxxx
    sw          = ident_clean[10:20][::-1]  # next  10 digits reversed -> 1267xxxxxx

Detection — primary path (all originally-known bins):

    The 4-byte ROM header magic \x85\x0a\xf0\x30 at offset 0 is the primary
    and strongest positive anchor.  It is unique to M1.x and absent from every
    other known Bosch family.

Detection — fallback path (BMW M1.7 and Opel M1.x bins without the standard header magic):

    A subset of BMW M1.7 bins (observed: E36 318i 1.8i 0261200520, E36 318is
    0261203590 32KB, E36 316 0261203660 64KB) do NOT have the \x85\x0a\xf0\x30
    magic at offset 0 — their first bytes differ (e.g. \x00\x0a\xf0\x30,
    \x85\x99\x35\xd3, \x02\x00\x73\x02).  They are still unmistakably M1.x:

      - The '"0000000M1.7' family marker is present in the upper ROM region.
      - The file size is exactly 32KB or 64KB.
      - A valid reversed-digit ident (hw=0261xxxxxx, sw=1267xxxxxx) decodes
        correctly from the standard ident region (or, for the 64KB variant,
        from the last 4KB with a small FF-byte gap between the two digit runs).

    The BMW fallback (Phase 2b) fires when all three of the above conditions
    hold simultaneously.  Opel M1.x petrol ECUs (Phase 2c) use the identical
    reversed-digit ident encoding but carry no ROM header magic AND no BMW
    family marker; they are also accepted when the file is exactly 32KB or 64KB
    and the ident decodes to the 0261/1267 prefixes that uniquely identify
    Bosch M1.x petrol ECUs regardless of manufacturer.

64KB variant — split ident:

    The 64KB BMW E36 316 (0261203660) stores its ident in the last 4KB of the
    ROM, split across two contiguous digit runs separated by exactly 2–3 \xff
    bytes:

      run1: 27 ASCII digits   e.g. '066302162000785376215589371'
      gap:  2–3 \xff bytes
      run2:  3 ASCII digits   e.g. '571'
      suffix: optional '.NN'

    Concatenating run1+run2 before decoding yields the correct 30-digit ident:
      hw = concat[0:10][::-1] = '0261203660'
      sw = concat[10:20][::-1] = '1267358700'

    This gap-tolerant search is used ONLY when the standard contiguous pattern
    finds nothing, and ONLY for files that already passed the family-marker
    and size gates.

M1.8 — Volvo 960 / 940 / 240 inline-6 petrol engines (~1989–1995)
  Bosch Motronic M1.8, SAB80C515 (8051-family) CPU.
  ROM size: exactly 32KB (0x8000).
  Detection: Phase 2d — the '"0000000M0.0' family marker is present
             in the binary AND the b'M1.8' ASCII string is present
             AND the file size is 32KB or 64KB.
  The '"0000000M0.0' marker is the 8051-era placeholder used in Volvo
  M1.8 binaries; the actual family is identified by the separate 'M1.8'
  string embedded in the ident block near 0x7EA0.

  Unlike M1.3/M1.7 bins, the M1.8 does NOT use reversed-digit ident
  encoding.  Instead, the ident is a structured ASCII block:

    Format: E<rev>M18<spaces><digit_seq>M1.8<spaces><revision>
    e.g.  : "E00M18     928618124110227400035M1.8  0000"

    Fields:
      E<rev>   : ECU hardware revision (e.g. "E00")
      M18      : Short family name
      digit_seq: Volvo OEM part + Bosch coding (variable length, 15–25 digits)
                 First 7 digits = Volvo part number (e.g. "9286181" = Volvo 928 618-1)
      M1.8     : Full family name
      revision : 4-digit revision code (e.g. "0000")

  HW / SW in the filename (0261200528 / 357234) are NOT stored as ASCII
  in the binary.  Partial BCD-encoded values appear at the ROM tail:
    0x7FF2: last 4 digits of HW as packed BCD (e.g. 0x0528 → "0528")
    0x7FF4: last 4 digits of SW as packed BCD (e.g. 0x7234 → "7234")
  These are used for verification but cannot reconstruct the full numbers.

  match_key uses the full digit sequence from the ident block as the
  unique calibration fingerprint.
