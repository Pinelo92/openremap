# Interactive TUI

OpenRemap ships with a full interactive Terminal User Interface built with
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/). It exposes every core feature —
identify, scan, cook, tune, validate — without touching the command line.

**Launch it:**

```bash
openremap          # no arguments → opens the TUI
openremap-tui      # dedicated entry point (identical)
```

No server, no database, no internet connection required.

## Layout

The screen is split into two regions:

| Region | Description |
|---|---|
| **Sidebar** (left) | Navigation buttons for the seven panels, branding, and version number. |
| **Content area** (right) | A `ContentSwitcher` that displays whichever panel is active. |

Click a sidebar button or press `1`–`7` on your keyboard to switch panels.

## Panels

### ⚡ Identify — `1`

Single-file ECU binary identification.

Browse for a binary or type its path, then press **IDENTIFY**. The panel
displays a result table with the following fields:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| Manufacturer | Bosch |
| ECU Family | EDC17 |
| ECU Variant | EDC17C46 |
| Software Version | 03L906012A 9977 |
| Hardware Number | 0281017696 |
| Calibration ID | — |
| Match Key | — |
| File Size | 2,097,152 bytes |
| SHA-256 | `a1b2c3…` |

Below the identification fields the panel shows a **confidence assessment**:

- **Tier badge** — a four-dot indicator:
  `●●●●` High, `●●●○` Medium, `●●○○` Low, `●○○○` Suspicious, `○○○○` Unknown
- **Numeric score** — the raw point total from signal analysis.
- **Signal breakdown** — each signal that contributed to the score, shown with
  a green `▲` (positive) or red `▼` (negative) marker and its point delta.
- **Warnings** — any `⚠` notes emitted by the confidence engine.

---

### ⬡ Scan — `2`

Batch-scan an entire directory of ECU binaries.

Browse for a directory (or type its path), then press **SCAN**. Every file is
identified and classified. Results appear in a `DataTable` with these columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| File | Relative path inside the scanned directory |
| Manufacturer | Detected manufacturer name |
| Family | ECU family (e.g. EDC17, MED17) |
| Software Version | Extracted software version string |
| Confidence | Tier badge and tier label |
| Category | Classification result (see below) |

**Category colour coding:**

| Category | Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ✓ scanned | Green | Successfully identified |
| ⚠ unmatched | Yellow | Extractor matched but software version is missing or unknown |
| ✗ contested | Red | Multiple extractors claim the file — ambiguous |
| ? unknown | Dim | No extractor matched |
| ⌫ unsupported | Dim | File extension is not a recognised ECU binary type |

**Toggle buttons:**

- **By Manufacturer** — groups organised output by manufacturer only (default).
- **Detailed** — groups by manufacturer _and_ family, creating deeper subfolders.

**ORGANISE button** — enabled after a scan completes. Pressing it moves every
scanned file into manufacturer/family subfolders under the `ECUs/` working
directory. Unmatched files go to `<Manufacturer>/Unmatched`, contested files
to `Contested/`, unknowns to `Unknown/`, and unsupported files to
`Unsupported/`.

### ⚗ Cook — `3`

Diff two binaries to produce a `.remap` recipe file.

Three file inputs are arranged in columns:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| **Original binary** | The unmodified (stock) ECU file |
| **Modified binary** | The tuned ECU file |
| **Output recipe** | Where to save the resulting `.openremap` recipe |

Each input has a **Browse** button (or **Save as…** for the output). Press
**COOK** to diff the two binaries. The result panel shows the generated recipe
summary — number of instructions, byte ranges, and metadata.

---

### ⟳ Tune — `4`

One-shot workflow: validate → apply → verify.

Three file inputs:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| **Target binary** | The ECU binary to patch |
| **Recipe file** | A `.openremap` recipe produced by Cook |
| **Output binary** | Where to save the tuned result |

Press **TUNE** to run the full three-phase process:

1. **Phase 1 — Pre-flight check** (`validate before`): confirms that original
   bytes exist at the recorded offsets.
2. **Phase 2 — Apply recipe**: writes modified bytes into a copy of the target.
3. **Phase 3 — Post-tune verification** (`validate after`): confirms that
   modified bytes are now present at the expected offsets.

The result panel shows a phase checklist (`✅` / `❌` / `○`) at the top,
followed by a status summary. On success the output path is displayed along
with a prominent **checksum warning** — OpenRemap does _not_ correct checksums,
so the output must be processed by a dedicated tool (ECM Titanium, WinOLS,
MPPS, Flex, etc.) before flashing.

If any phase fails, a diagnostic message explains the failure and suggests
the appropriate Validate mode to investigate further.

---

### ✔ Validate — `5`

Run individual validation steps against a binary and recipe pair.

Two file inputs:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| **Binary file** | The ECU binary to validate (stock _or_ tuned, depending on mode) |
| **Recipe file** | The `.openremap` recipe to validate against |

Three **mode buttons** select the validation type:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Before** | Pre-flight check — verifies original bytes exist at the recorded offsets. Run this _before_ tuning. |
| **Check** | Diagnostic search — scans the _entire_ binary for original bytes regardless of offset. Use this to diagnose failures when Before reports mismatches. |
| **After** | Post-patch confirmation — verifies modified bytes were written correctly. Run this _after_ tuning. |

The result panel shows per-instruction pass/fail status with offset, expected
bytes, and actual bytes for any failures.

---

### ≡ Families — `6`

Read-only reference panel listing every ECU family registered in the current
installation. Displays a `DataTable` with columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Manufacturer | The manufacturer that owns this family |
| Family | Family name (e.g. EDC17, MED17, Simtec 56) |
| # Sub-variants | Number of sub-variants registered for this family |

The table is sorted by manufacturer and family. This is the same information
printed by the `openremap families` CLI command.

---

### ℹ About — `7`

Project information panel showing:

- Version number
- Project description
- Registered extractor and family counts
- Links to GitHub and PyPI
- CLI quick-reference (every command with an example invocation)
- Checksum warning reminder

---

## File dialogs

Browse buttons open a **native file dialog** appropriate for your platform:

| Platform | File picker | Folder picker |
|---|---|---|
| Linux (GNOME) | `zenity --file-selection` | `zenity --file-selection --directory` |
| Linux (KDE) | `kdialog --getopenfilename` | `kdialog --getexistingdirectory` |
| macOS | `osascript` (`choose file` / `choose folder`) | `osascript` (`choose folder`) |
| Windows | `tkinter.filedialog` | `tkinter.filedialog.askdirectory` |

The TUI tries `zenity` first, then falls back to `kdialog`. If neither is
installed (and you are not on macOS or Windows), the dialog silently returns
nothing and the panel displays a notice:

> No file dialog available. Install zenity (Linux) or kdialog (KDE) and retry.

You can always **type or paste a path directly** into the text input and press
Enter — the file dialog is a convenience, not a requirement.

File type filters are applied automatically:

- **Binary inputs** filter for `*.bin`, `*.ori` (with an "All files" fallback).
- **Recipe inputs** filter for `*.openremap`, `*.json` (with an "All files" fallback).
- **Save-as dialogs** use the same filters as their corresponding input type.

---

## Working directories

On first launch the TUI creates a working directory tree for default file
dialog locations:

| Platform | Base path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `C:\Users\<name>\Documents\OpenRemap\` |
| macOS | `/Users/<name>/Documents/OpenRemap/` |
| Linux | `~/Documents/OpenRemap/` (falls back to `~/OpenRemap/` if `~/Documents` does not exist) |

Inside the base directory three subdirectories are created:

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `recipes/` | Default location for saved `.openremap` recipe files |
| `tunes/` | Default location for tuned output binaries |
| `ECUs/` | Root for organised ECU binaries (populated by the Scan → Organise feature) |

These directories are only used as starting points for file dialogs — you are
free to browse anywhere on your filesystem.
