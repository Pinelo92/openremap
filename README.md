**Open-source ECU binary identification, diffing, and patching toolkit.**
Free alternative to the identification and binary-diff workflows locked inside WinOLS, ECM Titanium, and similar commercial tools.

> Runs on your machine. No internet. No account. No data leaves your hands — ever.

## The problem

ECU tuners work with raw binary files — `.bin` dumps read from engine control units. Every day they need to:

1. **Figure out what a binary is** — which manufacturer, which ECU family, which software revision
2. **Compare two binaries** — what exactly changed between a stock file and a tuned file
3. **Apply those changes to another file** — take a known-good tune and patch it onto a different binary of the same ECU

Today, these tasks require expensive commercial software (€2,500–€8,000+), or manual hex-editor work with no audit trail and no safety net.

## What OpenRemap does

OpenRemap is a **free, offline, open-source toolkit** that handles the binary analysis and patching pipeline:

| Step | Command | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Identify** | `openremap identify ecu.bin` | Reads the binary and tells you: manufacturer, ECU family, software version, hardware number, calibration ID — plus a confidence score rating how likely the file is unmodified |
| **Scan** | `openremap scan ./bins/` | Batch-identifies every binary in a folder. Sorts them into `Bosch/EDC17/`, `Siemens/PPD/`, etc. Flags suspicious files before you touch them |
| **Cook** | `openremap cook stock.bin tuned.bin` | Diffs two binaries byte-by-byte and produces a `.remap` recipe — a portable JSON file listing every changed byte with context anchors. Readable in any text editor, diffable in Git |
| **Tune** | `openremap tune target.bin recipe.remap` | Validates the recipe against the target binary, applies the patch, then verifies every byte landed correctly. All-or-nothing — partial patches never happen |

### What it does NOT do

- **Map editing** — OpenRemap works at the byte level, not the map level. Use WinOLS or ECM Titanium to find and edit maps. Use OpenRemap to capture, share, and reapply those edits.
- **Checksum correction** — you must run the output through WinOLS, ECM Titanium, or equivalent before flashing. Always.
- **ECU reading/writing** — it operates on `.bin` files you already have.

## Coverage

30 extractors across 4 manufacturers, covering ECUs from 1982 to present:

| Manufacturer | Families | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Bosch** (18) | EDC17, EDC16, EDC15, ME7, ME9, M5.x, M4.x, M3.x, M2.x, M1.x, MP9, ME1.5.5, LH-Jetronic, Mono-Motronic, and more | VAG TDI, BMW, Volvo, PSA, Porsche, Alfa Romeo |
| **Siemens** (6) | SIMOS, PPD, SID 801/803, Simtec 56, EMS2000 | VAG petrol, PSA/Ford diesel, Volvo turbo |
| **Delphi** (2) | Multec, Multec S | Opel/Vauxhall diesel and petrol |
| **Marelli** (4) | IAW 1AV, IAW 1AP, IAW 4LV, MJD 6JF | Fiat, PSA, GM/Opel |

## Confidence scoring

Every identification includes a confidence verdict — `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `SUSPICIOUS`, or `UNKNOWN` — built from multiple signals:

- **Detection strength** — how rigorous the extractor's matching cascade is
- **Software version format** — manufacturer-aware canonical format checking (Bosch `1037`-prefixed, Delphi 8-digit GM-style, etc.)
- **Identity fields present** — hardware number, calibration ID, ECU variant
- **Filename analysis** — tuning keywords (`stage2`, `dpf_off`, `egr_off`) and generic names (`1.bin`) flag suspicious files
- **Family-aware scoring** — ECU families that architecturally lack certain fields are never penalised for their absence

→ [Full scoring breakdown](docs/confidence.md)

## The recipe format

The `.remap` recipe is a self-contained JSON file. Every changed byte is listed with its offset, original value, modified value, and a context anchor — 32 bytes of surrounding data that let the patcher find the right location even if the binary has shifted slightly between software revisions.

Recipes are human-readable, Git-diffable, and shareable. No proprietary format, no binary blobs.

→ [Recipe format specification](docs/recipe-format.md)

## Install

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. One command to get started:

```bash
pip install openremap
```

Or with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended):

```bash
uv tool install openremap
```

Detailed guides:

- 🪟 **Windows** — [Step-by-step guide](docs/install/windows.md) · written for people who rarely use a terminal
- 🍎 **macOS / 🐧 Linux** — [One-command install](docs/install/macos-linux.md)
- 🛠️ **Contributing / development** — [Clone and run from source](docs/install/developers.md)

---

## Get started

```bash
openremap
```

That's it. The full terminal UI launches — identify files, scan folders, cook recipes, and apply tunes, all from one interface. No flags to memorise.

The complete CLI is still there when you need it:

```bash
openremap workflow    # Prints a plain-English guide with every step and command
openremap commands    # Quick reference for all available commands
```

> ⚠️ **Checksum verification is mandatory.** Before flashing any tuned binary to a vehicle, you **must** run it through a dedicated checksum correction tool (ECM Titanium, WinOLS, or equivalent). `openremap tune` confirms the recipe was applied correctly — it does **not** correct or validate ECU checksums. Flashing a binary with an incorrect checksum **will brick your ECU.**
